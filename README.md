## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Sass
- [Sass Boilerplate](https://github.com/KittyGiraudel/sass-boilerplate) - Sass module system



### What I learned

In this project I applied using the normalize.scss file which resets all default browser styles. 



### Continued development

On to the next projects I will still continue to fix my previous designs. In my next project I'm gonna try to fix it by vanilla CSS and its variables. 


### Useful resources

- [Sass Boilerplate](https://github.com/KittyGiraudel/sass-boilerplate) - This helped me to build my own boilerplate since this is still using the @import.
